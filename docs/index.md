My name is Ryosuke Yoneda.
I studied informatics at Kyoto University and conducted theoretical and experimental research on coupled phase-oscillator models.
After obtaining my Ph.D., I joined the data science department of Nomura Securities.
I am currently engaged in tasks related to financial data analysis and machine learning applications.
I am interested in mathematical models and network science, and I want to understand the dynamics of complex systems in nature and social phenomena.
My hobbies are reading and programming.
Nice to meet you!!
